<blockquote>Study Buddy helps students find classmates to study with on the fly. This app is setup for the UCF library as the primary loaction (with more locations coming soon), where you can search for or create a study group. The goal is to allow an open invitation to anyone wanting to study, thus eliminating the need to awkwardly approach strangers.</blockquote>
