<blockquote>Study Buddy helps students find classmates to study with on the fly. This app is setup for the UCF library as the primary location (with more locations coming soon), where you can search for or create a study group. Study Buddy creates an open invitation to anyone wanting to study, thus eliminating the need to awkwardly approach strangers. Sign in with Facebook or Twitter to get started!</blockquote>
