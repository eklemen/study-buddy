# study-buddy
**TIY final project**

This web-app allows students to meet with other students and study together. Students can search for active groups or create their own. Enter the subject and class you are studying for and the location in UCF's library you can be found. Then you are instantly viewable by anyone else using the app. Dont't feel awkward asking to join strangers, now you have an open invitation to study and meet people.
